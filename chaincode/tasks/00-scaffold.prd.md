# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Hyperledger Fabric Node.js Smart Contract Development Project

---

## 📋 Project Overview

Create a minimal, production-ready Node.js/JavaScript project structure for
developing Hyperledger Fabric smart contracts (chaincode) with local blockchain
testing capabilities.

Scope:

• Smart contract development environment using Node.js/JavaScript
• Local Hyperledger Fabric network for testing and development
• Automation scripts for network management and contract deployment
• Starting point using official asset-transfer-javascript sample chaincode

---

## 🎯 Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. Establish a clean, minimal project structure for Hyperledger Fabric smart
contract development
2. Provide local development environment with automated network setup and
teardown
3. Enable rapid prototyping using official sample chaincode as a foundation
4. Support modern development practices including debugging and hot-reloading
capabilities

### Success Criteria

[ ] Local Fabric network can be started/stopped with single commands
[ ] Sample chaincode deploys successfully to local network
[ ] Chaincode can be tested via peer CLI
[ ] Project structure supports easy replacement of sample with business logic
[ ] Development workflow supports debugging and iterative development

## 📦 Component Specifications

### 1. Smart Contract Module (contracts/)

• Purpose: Contains JavaScript chaincode implementations
• Initial Implementation: Copy of asset-transfer-javascript from fabric-samples
• Structure:
 • package.json - Dependencies and runtime scripts
 • index.js - Chaincode entry point
 • lib/asset.js - Data models
 • lib/assetTransfer.js - Business logic
• Runtime Modes:
 • Standard mode (start)
 • Server mode non-TLS (start:server-nontls)
 • Server mode with TLS (start:server)
 • Debug mode (start:server-debug)


### 2. Test Network Module (test-network/)

• Purpose: Local Hyperledger Fabric network for development
• Source: Direct copy from hyperledger/fabric-samples
• Key Scripts:
 • network.sh - Network lifecycle management
 • monitordocker.sh - Container monitoring
• Network Configuration:
 • 2 organization peers
 • 1 ordering service node
 • Certificate Authorities enabled
 • Optional CouchDB support


### 3. Automation Scripts (scripts/)

• Purpose: Streamline development workflow
• Required Scripts:
 • start-local.sh - Start network and deploy chaincode
 • deploy-contract.sh - Deploy/upgrade chaincode
 • test.sh - Basic chaincode testing


---

## 🔧 Functional Requirements

### Network Management

• FR-001: Start local Fabric network with single command
• FR-002: Stop and clean up network resources
• FR-003: Monitor network container status
• FR-004: Support both standard and Chaincode-as-a-Service (CCaaS) deployment
modes

### Chaincode Development

• FR-005: Deploy JavaScript chaincode to local network
• FR-006: Support hot-reloading in development mode
• FR-007: Enable Node.js debugging capabilities
• FR-008: Validate chaincode deployment success

### Testing & Verification

• FR-009: Execute basic chaincode functions via peer CLI
• FR-010: Verify ledger state after transactions
• FR-011: Support automated testing scripts

---

## 🎛️ Non-Functional Requirements

### Reliability

• Script execution error handling and reporting

### Usability

• Single-command network operations
• Clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance
• Comprehensive README with setup instructions

### Maintainability

• Project structure follows Hyperledger Fabric best practices
• Scripts support different development environments
• Easy upgrade path for Fabric version updates
